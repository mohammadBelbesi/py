# 🔺📐 Zelda Triangle Series Explorer

An interactive Python application for visualizing and analyzing the famous “Zelda Triangle” recursive pattern — a beautiful blend of mathematics, recursion, geometry, and data visualization. Built using Tkinter, Matplotlib, and the math module, this tool allows students and enthusiasts to explore how triangles evolve through recursive steps.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Recursively draw red triangles inside a large white triangle using fractal-like logic.
- 📊 Display two live-updating graphs:
  - Number of red and white triangles per stage.
  - Total area per stage.
- 🧮 Dynamic calculation of:
  - Red triangle count
  - White triangle count
  - Total area covered
- 📁 Export results to CSV for any stage (n ≥ 1)
- 🎨 Smooth visual animation of triangle generation.
- ✅ Error-handling and intuitive GUI.
- 🔴 Custom Exit button and graceful exit handling (both via button and window close).

## 💡 Educational Purpose

Designed as a final high school project in Mathematics & Computer Science, this app helps students:
- Understand geometric recursion and fractals
- Practice Python programming and GUI development
- Apply data visualization concepts
- Think computationally and visually

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Matplotlib (Graph plotting)
- CSV (Data export)
- math (Geometry & calculations)
- time (for smooth animations)
